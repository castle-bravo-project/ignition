# Ignition GitHub App Architecture

## Executive Summary

The Ignition GitHub App represents a strategic pivot from Personal Access Token (PAT) authentication to enterprise-grade GitHub App architecture. This enables organization-wide installation, enhanced security, granular permissions, and comprehensive compliance audit trails for meta-project management.

## Architecture Overview

### Core Principles
- **Organization-First Design**: Deploy at GitHub organization level as root project manager
- **Enterprise Security**: App-level authentication with fine-grained permissions
- **Compliance-Ready**: Built-in audit trails and regulatory compliance features
- **Scalable Architecture**: Support for multiple organizations and repositories
- **Meta-Management**: Self-managing development process with automated governance

### Strategic Vision
Deploy Ignition as the organizational root project to:
- Manage and monitor all repositories within the organization
- Provide compliance tooling to other teams and external organizations
- Achieve meta-compliance where the tool manages its own development
- Offer enterprise-grade project management as a service

## GitHub App vs OAuth Comparison

| Feature | Personal Access Token | GitHub App |
|---------|----------------------|------------|
| **Scope** | User-level access | Organization-level |
| **Permissions** | Broad, user-defined | Fine-grained, app-specific |
| **Installation** | Manual per repository | Organization-wide |
| **Security** | User credentials | App-level authentication |
| **Audit Trail** | Limited user actions | Comprehensive app actions |
| **Rate Limits** | User-based (5,000/hour) | App-based (15,000/hour) |
| **Enterprise Features** | Limited | Full enterprise support |
| **Compliance** | Manual tracking | Automated audit trails |

    participant Org as GitHub Organization
    participant App as Ignition App
    participant API as GitHub API
    participant User as End User
    
    Org->>App: Install App
    App->>API: Generate Installation Token
    API->>App: Return JWT Token
    User->>App: Access Dashboard
    App->>API: Make Authenticated Requests
    API->>App: Return Repository Data
    App->>User: Display Project Dashboard
```

### Permission Model
#### Repository Permissions
- **Contents**: Read/Write for project data synchronization
- **Issues**: Read/Write for issue tracking and management
- **Pull Requests**: Read/Write for code review integration
- **Actions**: Read for CI/CD pipeline monitoring
- **Security Events**: Read for vulnerability monitoring
- **Metadata**: Read for repository information

#### Organization Permissions
- **Members**: Read for user management and access control
- **Administration**: Read for organization-level insights
- **Plan**: Read for billing and usage analytics

### Webhook Architecture
#### Event Subscriptions
- **Repository Events**: push, pull_request, issues, release
- **Security Events**: security_advisory, dependabot_alert
- **Organization Events**: member_added, repository_created
- **Installation Events**: installation, installation_repositories

#### Webhook Processing
```typescript
interface WebhookEvent {
  event: string;
  payload: any;
  installation: {
    id: number;
    account: {
      login: string;
      type: 'Organization' | 'User';
    };
  };
}

class WebhookProcessor {
  async processEvent(event: WebhookEvent): Promise<void> {
    switch (event.event) {
      case 'push':
        await this.handleCodeChanges(event);
        break;
      case 'pull_request':
        await this.handlePullRequest(event);
        break;
      case 'security_advisory':
        await this.handleSecurityAlert(event);
        break;
      case 'installation':
        await this.handleInstallation(event);
        break;
    }
  }
}
```

## Security Framework

### Authentication Security
- **JWT Tokens**: Short-lived installation tokens (1 hour expiry)
- **Private Key Management**: Secure storage of GitHub App private key
- **Token Rotation**: Automatic token refresh and rotation
- **Webhook Verification**: HMAC signature verification for all webhooks

### Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest**: AES-256 encryption for stored project data
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all API communications
- **Access Controls**: Role-based access with principle of least privilege
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all app actions

### Compliance Features
- **SOX Compliance**: Financial controls and audit trails
- **GDPR Compliance**: Data privacy and user consent management
- **HIPAA Compliance**: Healthcare data protection (when applicable)
- **FedRAMP**: Federal security requirements (future consideration)
