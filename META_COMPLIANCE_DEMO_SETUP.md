# 🎯 Meta-Compliance Demonstration Setup Guide

## Overview
This guide will walk you through setting up Ignition to demonstrate its meta-compliance capabilities by using the tool to scaffold and manage a repository for its own GitHub App deployment.

## 🚀 Current Status
✅ Ignition is running locally at http://localhost:5173/  
✅ Environment configuration template created  
⏳ GitHub PAT token configuration needed  

## 📋 Next Steps

### Step 1: Configure GitHub Personal Access Token

1. **Generate a GitHub PAT:**
   - Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Click "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Select the following scopes:
     - ✅ `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
     - ✅ `admin:org` (Full control of orgs and teams, read and write org projects)
     - ✅ `workflow` (Update GitHub Action workflows)
     - ✅ `write:packages` (Upload packages to GitHub Package Registry)

2. **Update .env.local file:**
   - Replace `your_github_personal_access_token_here` with your actual PAT
   - Replace `your-org` with your GitHub organization name
   - Example:
     ```bash
     VITE_GITHUB_PAT=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
     VITE_GITHUB_REPO_URL=https://github.com/YourOrg/ignition-github-app
     ```

### Step 2: Meta-Compliance Demonstration Process

Once the GitHub PAT is configured, we will:

1. **Access Ignition Dashboard** at http://localhost:5173/
2. **Configure GitHub Integration** in the Settings page
3. **Create New Repository** for `ignition-github-app` deployment
4. **Generate AI Assessment** for the GitHub App deployment process
5. **Scaffold Repository** using Ignition's built-in capabilities
6. **Document the Process** showing meta-compliance in action

### Step 3: Expected Outcomes

The demonstration will show:
- ✨ **Meta-Compliance**: Ignition managing its own deployment process
- 🤖 **AI Assessment Generation**: Automated evaluation of deployment requirements
- 📊 **Process Documentation**: Real-time generation of compliance artifacts
- 🔄 **Self-Management**: Tool creating and managing its own repository structure
- 📈 **Organizational Intelligence**: Relationship mapping and impact analysis

## 🎬 Demo Script

### Phase 1: Setup Verification
1. Open Ignition at http://localhost:5173/
2. Navigate to Settings → GitHub Integration
3. Verify PAT token configuration
4. Test repository access

### Phase 2: Repository Creation
1. Use Ignition's repository creation feature
2. Create `ignition-github-app` repository
3. Configure initial repository settings

### Phase 3: AI Assessment Generation
1. Navigate to Assessment Generator
2. Create deployment assessment for GitHub App
3. Generate compliance documentation

### Phase 4: Repository Scaffolding
1. Use Ignition's scaffolding capabilities
2. Generate complete repository structure
3. Commit all files using the tool

### Phase 5: Meta-Compliance Documentation
1. Document the entire process
2. Generate compliance reports
3. Create audit trail

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
- **403 Forbidden**: PAT token lacks required scopes
- **404 Not Found**: Repository URL incorrect or doesn't exist
- **Rate Limiting**: GitHub API rate limits exceeded

### Solutions:
- Verify PAT scopes include `repo` and `admin:org`
- Check repository URL format
- Wait for rate limit reset or use authenticated requests

## 📚 Reference Documentation

All GitHub Developer Program documentation is ready:
- ✅ GITHUB_DEVELOPER_PROGRAM_APPLICATION.md

## 🎯 Success Criteria

The demonstration is successful when:
1. Ignition creates its own deployment repository
2. AI generates comprehensive deployment assessment
3. Repository is fully scaffolded with compliance documentation
4. Process is documented showing meta-compliance capabilities
5. GitHub Developer Program submission is ready
