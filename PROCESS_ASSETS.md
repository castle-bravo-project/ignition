```
## Risk Playbook: External API Integration

- **Risk ID:** RISK-API-INT-XXX
- **Risk Name:** Changes in External API Functionality or Availability
- **Description:** The system depends on external third-party APIs (e.g., Gemini, GitHub). Changes to these APIs (breaking changes, deprecation, rate limits, downtime) could cause system functionality to fail or degrade.
- **Category:** External, Technical
- **Likelihood:** Medium
- **Impact:** High
- **Risk Level:** High

### Potential Triggers:
- API provider releases a new version with breaking changes.
- API provider deprecates an old API version.
- API experiences unexpected downtime or performance issues.
- System usage exceeds API rate limits.
- API provider changes terms of service or authentication methods.

### Mitigation Steps:
1.  **Monitoring:** Implement proactive monitoring of external API status and performance.
2.  **Versioning:** Utilize API versioning whenever possible and plan for migration to newer versions.
3.  **Abstraction Layer:** Implement an abstraction layer or facade pattern to isolate system code from direct API calls, making it easier to swap or adapt APIs.
4.  **Graceful Degradation:** Design features to degrade gracefully if an API is unavailable or returns errors (e.g., provide cached results, display informative error messages).
5.  **Rate Limit Handling:** Implement logic to detect and handle API rate limits, including retries with exponential backoff.
6.  **API Documentation & Communication:** Regularly review API provider documentation and subscribe to their status/update notifications.
7.  **Testing:** Include tests specifically for API integration points, especially after API provider announcements or suspected changes.
8.  **Alternative APIs/Fallbacks:** Identify potential alternative APIs or fallback mechanisms where critical functionality depends on a single external API.
9.  **Local Caching:** Implement local caching for frequently accessed data from the API to reduce calls and dependency on real-time availability.

### Contingency Plan:
- If an API experiences prolonged downtime or a severe breaking change, communicate impact to stakeholders, activate graceful degradation measures, and prioritize fixing or migrating the integration.
