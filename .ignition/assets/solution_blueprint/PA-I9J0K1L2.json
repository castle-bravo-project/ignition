    "template": "## Solution Blueprint: Data Import/Export\n\nThis blueprint outlines the key considerations and steps for implementing data import and export features.\n\n### 1. Requirements Analysis:\n- Identify data entities to be imported/exported.\n- Determine supported file formats (e.g., CSV, JSON, XML, custom binary).\n- Define data mapping requirements (how source/target fields map to system fields).\n- Specify volume and performance expectations.\n- Define security and access control requirements.\n- Determine error handling and reporting needs.\n\n### 2. Design Considerations:\n- **Format Handling:** Implement parsers/serializers for supported formats.\n- **Mapping:** Design a flexible mapping mechanism (manual UI, configuration files, auto-mapping).\n- **Validation:** Define validation rules for incoming data (schema, data types, constraints).\n- **Processing:** Decide on processing strategy (batch processing, streaming, background jobs).\n- **Error Handling:** Design mechanisms to log errors, report failures to the user, and handle partial successes/failures.\n- **Performance:** Consider chunking data, asynchronous processing, and database indexing for large datasets.\n- **Security:** Ensure data integrity, confidentiality, and proper authentication/authorization.\n- **User Interface:** Design clear UI for selecting files, mapping fields, tracking progress, and viewing results/errors.\n\n### 3. Implementation Steps:\n1. Develop data parsers/serializers for required formats.\n2. Implement data validation logic based on system schema and business rules.\n3. Build the data mapping interface or configuration.\n4. Implement the core import/export processing logic (reading, transforming, validating, writing).\n5. Integrate with background job processing system if asynchronous operations are needed.\n6. Develop user interface components for initiating and monitoring imports/exports.\n7. Implement error logging and reporting features.\n8. Write unit and integration tests for import/export paths.\n\n### 4. Testing:\n- **Unit Tests:** Test parsers, serializers, validation rules.\n- **Integration Tests:** Test the end-to-end import/export flow with various data sets and formats.\n- **Performance Tests:** Test with large volumes of data.\n- **Error Handling Tests:** Test with invalid data, corrupted files, edge cases.\n- **Security Tests:** Test access controls and data integrity.\n\n### 5. Deployment & Monitoring:\n- Deploy the import/export features.\n- Monitor system resources during processing.\n- Monitor error logs for import/export failures.",
