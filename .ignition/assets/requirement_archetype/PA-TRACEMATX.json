The matrix should show the links between [Item Type 1] and [Item Type 2] based on defined relationships (e.g., requirements traced to verification tests).\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n*   The system provides a mechanism (e.g., a dedicated view, report generation) to access the traceability matrix.\n*   The displayed matrix correctly shows links between specified artifact types.\n*   Users can identify which [Item Type 1] items are linked to which [Item Type 2] items and vice-versa.\n*   [Optional] Filtering or sorting options are available for the matrix.\n\n**Traceability:** [Link to parent requirement, design element, or test case]",
